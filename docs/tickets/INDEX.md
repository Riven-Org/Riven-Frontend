# Ticket index

Generated from the Riven product backlog (also in ClickUp: Team Space → Riven-Prodcut).
Do not edit by hand; scope changes go through the backlog and are regenerated.

`Repos` shows where each story's tasks live. **This repo: frontend.** Open `<story-id>.md` for full details; a task ID like S01.2.3 lives in `S01.2.md`.
